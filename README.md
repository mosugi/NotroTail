</p>

## Quick Start

```sh
npm create notro@latest my-site
```

The CLI will download the starter template, create `.env` from `.env.example`, and optionally install dependencies. Then edit `.env` with your Notion credentials and run `npm run dev`.

See the [documentation](https://github.com/mosugi/notro/tree/main/templates/docs) for detailed setup instructions.

## Features

### 🚀 Content-First

Create content and build a website with Notion’s user-friendly interface. No coding knowledge required.

### ⚡️ High Performance

Websites are output as static HTML by Astro, making them extremely fast and optimized for SEO. Whether for personal blogs or business purposes, it offers a great experience.

### 🔌 No Block-by-Block Retrieval — Fast Builds

Supports Notion's [Markdown Content API](https://developers.notion.com/guides/data-apis/working-with-markdown-content), so page content is fetched in a single API call rather than block by block. This significantly reduces the number of API calls at build time, resulting in fast builds.

### 📷 Image Optimization

Images used in Notion are delivered in WebP format, optimized for each device by Astro Assets.

### 🎨 Modern Styling

Integrated with TailwindCSS, it allows you to easily create modern and responsive sites.

### 📚 Templates & Free Format

Generate websites from database templates or create from specific pages in a free format.

### 🔧 Advanced Customization

In addition to changing pre-defined CSS in tailwind.css, you can apply utilities directly in Notion, defining the appearance close to the content. HTML can also be written for advanced customization.

## Installation Instructions

For running locally or in an environment without Notro Connect.

### 1. Create a Notion Internal Integration

Create an integration from [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration##step-1-create-an-integration) and record the **Internal Integration Token** as `NOTION_TOKEN`.

### 2. Select or Create a Notion Page

Choose an existing Notion page or duplicate a template. NotroTail works with any Notion page, but using a template provides rich features like headers and blogs.

### 3. Identify the Notion ID

Record the ID part of the URL as `NOTION_ID`.

```plaintext
https://www.notion.so/myworkspace/a8aec43384f447ed84390e8e42c2e089?v=...
                                 |---------- NOTION_ID ----------|
```

### 4. Configure Integration

Share the page with your integration following the steps [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration##step-2-share-a-database-with-your-integration).

### 5. Set Environment Variables

```bash
NOTION_TOKEN=<NOTION_TOKEN>
NOTION_DATASOURCE_ID=<NOTION_ID>
```

### 6. Launch

NotroTail needs Astro 7.0 and Node.js 24 or later.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321/) in your browser.

## Repository Structure

This repository is a **pnpm workspace monorepo** containing the following packages:

| Package | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| [`notro-loader`](./packages/notro-loader/) | `packages/notro-loader/` | Astro + Notion API integration library. Provides the Content Loader, the Sätteri MDX compile pipeline (including Notion markdown normalization), and headless Astro components for all Notion block types. See the [`notro-loader` README](./packages/notro-loader/README.md) for usage. |
| [`notro-ui`](./packages/notro-ui/) | `packages/notro-ui/` | Copy-and-own styled components for `notro-loader` (shadcn style). Run `notro-ui add --all` to install components into your project — they become your code, editable directly. |
| [`satteri-beautiful-mermaid`](./packages/satteri-beautiful-mermaid/) | `packages/satteri-beautiful-mermaid/` | Sätteri hast plugin that renders Mermaid code blocks to inline SVG at build time. |
| [`create-notro`](./packages/create-notro/) | `packages/create-notro/` | CLI scaffolding tool. Run `npm create notro@latest` to choose a template and scaffold a new site. |
| [`notro-md-sync`](./packages/notro-md-sync/) | `packages/notro-md-sync/` | CLI tool for bidirectional sync between local markdown files and a Notion data source. |
| `notro-blog` (blog) | `templates/blog/` | Full-featured blog template — reference implementation with blog list, tags, pagination, RSS, and SEO. |
| `notro-blank` (blank) | `templates/blank/` | Minimal starter — just pages and Notion content rendering. |
| `notro-basics` (basics) | `templates/basics/` | Minimal blog starter — a Notion database rendered as a posts collection, without the full blog template's tags/pagination/RSS. |
| `notro-gallery` (gallery) | `templates/gallery/` | Portfolio/works gallery starter, rendering a Notion database as a tagged works collection. |
| `notro-docs` (docs) | `templates/docs/` | Documentation site built with Astro Starlight — this is what powers [notrotail.mosugi.com/doc](https://notrotail.mosugi.com/doc). |

**Dependency graph:**
```
notro-loader  ←  notro-ui  ←  templates/blog
                                     ↑               ↑
                               create-notro  →  templates/blank
```

## Known Limitations

### Content truncation

The Notion API truncates page content at approximately **20,000 blocks**. There is no pagination API for this endpoint, so truncated content cannot be retrieved in full. notro logs a warning and builds with what is available.

**Workaround:** Split large Notion pages into smaller sub-pages.

### Unsupported block types

Some Notion block types cannot be converted to Markdown by the API. These blocks are silently omitted from the response. notro logs the affected block IDs so you can identify and update the content.

For details, see the [Notion API documentation](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-page-markdown) and the [`notro-loader` README](./packages/notro-loader/README.md#notion-api-limitations).
