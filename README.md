## Quick Start

Using [Notro Connect](https://notro.mosugi.com/) (Notion Public Integration), you can automatically set up IDs and tokens and deploy to platforms like Netlify in just a few steps. Give it a try! (And don't forget to star the repository!)

[Deploy to Netlify or Vercel with Notro Connect](https://notro.mosugi.com/)

## Features

### 🚀 Content-First

Create content and build a website with Notion’s user-friendly interface. No coding knowledge required.

### ⚡️ High Performance

Websites are output as static HTML by Astro, making them extremely fast and optimized for SEO. Whether for personal blogs or business purposes, it offers a great experience.

### 📷 Image Optimization

Images used in Notion are delivered in WebP format, optimized for each device by Astro Assets.

### 🎨 Modern Styling

Integrated with TailwindCSS, it allows you to easily create modern and responsive sites.

### 📚 Templates & Free Format

Generate websites from database templates or create from specific pages in a free format.

### 🔧 Advanced Customization

In addition to changing pre-defined CSS in tailwind.css, you can apply utilities directly in Notion, defining the appearance close to the content. HTML can also be written for advanced customization.
